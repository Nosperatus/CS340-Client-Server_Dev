How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable requires efficient commenting and adhering to industry best practice when writing code. Using naming conventions that are easy to read and intuitive in combination with commenting will help a programmed to read and maintain the code, even if they didn't write it themselves. The code in this project is adaptable and reusable, as both the CRUD Python module and Python/Dash compents can be referenced and reworked in the future.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

Approaching a problem as a computer scientist usually requires thorough analysis and breaking down the problem into smaller parts. In this project, we systematically built the full application. Starting with a back-end database MongoDB, moving on to creating a reusable Python class that can maniuplate the database, and finally using Python/Dash to create a web application for the user as a front-end dashboard.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Computer scientists can have a large range of skills and specializations, for data scientists, to developers, to QA testers, to production support/SRE, etc. Work like this would help a company to create software tools to achieve business needs, whether that is for another client or to help internal teams perform their jobs smarter/efficiently.
